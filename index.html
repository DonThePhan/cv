        <p><em><strong>Developer</strong> in Training</em></p>
        <p>I just jumped on the developer bandwagon a month ago and getting my hands
          deep into this. I've been doing this every day since then. Initially I
          appeared quite easy as it felt like a review of programming I had learned
          in highschool and first year university. Now that I'm caught up to all that
          and have begun to move beyond, I am starting to find this more of a
          challenge. Although I have learned many new things along the way like how
          to Object Oriented Programming and working with APIs which have been
          invaluable.</p>
